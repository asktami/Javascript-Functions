Javascript Functions


A method is a functions which is a property of an object.

There are 2 kinds of methods:

- Instance Methods which are built-in tasks performed on an object instance

- Static Methods which are tasks that can be performed without the need of an object instance

NOTE: Javascript functions are themselves objects, so, in that context, a method is actually an object reference to a function
